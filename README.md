# Wine quality analysis using Machine learning
``` 
RLIMCA369, Elective II - Python Programming Assignment 
```
The text dataset **winequality.csv** is used in this assignment. Intially preprocessing of the data is done and the missing values are properly handled. Libraries for preprocessing and machine learning are used in this assignment. 
> 1. Data Preprocessing 

After data preprocessing, data visualization and data analytics is down with the help of seaborn and matplotlib. Heat map is also generated to define the correlation between different fields. Now the data is split into 75% training and 25% testing data.
> 2. Training Phase

After traning the testing is done. Logistic regression is used here for the evaluation.
> 3. Testing Phase

The testing gave an accuracy of 88%, which is a fair accuracy for wine quality detection.
